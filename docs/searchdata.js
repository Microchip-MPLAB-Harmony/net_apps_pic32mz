command prompt displays the list of the available iperf commands/options: tcpip_iperf_project A brief description of the most important settings/commands follows: \"iperf\": starts the iperf session Use \"iperf -s\" for a server connection or \"iperf -c address\" for a client connection Look at the Iperf Module for examples of iperf benchmarks \"iperfk\" kills an ongoing iperf test This is mainly useful for killing a iperf server waiting for connections But the command could be also used to abort client test \"iperfi -a address\" allows to set the interface to use for iperf when the test is run on a multi-interface host When multiple iperf instabces are used the extra parameter \"-i\" could be used to specify the iperf index to which the command refers to \"iperfs\" command could be used to set the socket TX or RX buffer size dynamically For example: \"iperfs -tx 2048\" Note: The iperf demo uses very few TCP/IP modules to minimize the stack overhead and to obtain good throughput numbers However ICMP server NBNS and Announce modules are enabled to assist in the discovery of the board on the network DHCP client is also enabled for acquiring a valid IP address within the network Some of these modules could be further disabled if they are not used in the specific network environment of the application The data throughput could vary dependent on the iperf socket settings and the network conditions Larger TX and RX buffers will increase the corresponding throughput Various devices on the network on the link between the board and the machine running the iperf application (switches routers etc ) could also affect the throughput User can eliminate these effects by connecting the board running the iperf demo directly to the machine running the test on the PC side (Linux Windows etc ) ",

development board This will be printed on the serial port terminal Alternatively: Use the Announce service or ping to get the IP address of the board Run tcpip_discoverer jar to discover the IPv4 and IPv6 address for the board Execution: Once the demonstration starts executing we can observe the current IP settings at the Tera Term terminal port Using \"help\" will display the available commands that can be used for this demo The application can create 4 separate connections each one running in its own thread: A TCP client connection A TCP server connection A UDP client connection A UDP server connection Each connection has its own set of commands They can open or close the sockets send messages to the socket they are connected to they can display the received messages etc Using your preferred networking tools on the PC side ( netcat Packet Sender Hercules python scripts etc etc ) create sockets that talk to the ones opened by the client server application This way you can exchange data with any/all of the communication threads that the demonstration creates After the successful broad bring up the console output becomes tcpip_client_server_project For TCP Client test input the following command from the serial port: openurl url - The url argument must be a fully formed URL; for instance http://www microchip com/ For this above URL the DNS module will make a DNS query Then it will open a connection to the requested URL and perform a simple HTTP GET command The response received from the server will be printed on the terminal application through the serial port The expected output - tcpip_client_server_project For TCP Server test the TCP Client application is required to run on the computer (SocketTest Packet Sender etc) In this demonstration we use the program SocketTest (http://sockettest sourceforge net/) This demonstration is tested with SocketTest v3 0  Open the SocketTest software and set the configuration as shown in the following figure tcpip_tcp_client_server_project Press the Connect button on the SocketTest software after setting the configuration The serial terminal indicates that the connection has been established Type any

is 1883 \"mqtt qos\": setd the QoS Default is MQTT_QOS_0 \"mqtt topi\": sets the MQTT topic Default is \"MQTT_NET_Client topic\" \"mqtt tls\": sets the force TLS flag Default is 0 \"mqtt user\": sets the user name Default is \"MQTT_NET_User\" \"mqtt txbuf\": sets the size of the TX buffer for the connection Default is 1024 \"mqtt rxbuf\": sets the size of the RX buffer for the connection Default is 1024 Note: The connection to the broker is normally done using the port number: 1883 for plain connections 8883 for encrypted ones Wolf MQTT Connection: Using the \"force TLS\" will force an encrypted connection regardless of the port number The wolfMQTT demo is based on the examples provided by wolfMQTT To allow a simple usage of the wolfMQTT library a wolfMQTT NET Glue layer has been added to the Harmony port The NET glue layer takes care of all the connections to the broker supporting both encrypted and plain connections This way the application does not have to be concerned with the communication mechanisms and can use directly the wolfMQTT API on a Harmony platform without the need to add other supporting code The configuration parameters for the wolfmqtt demonstration are defined in the app_mqtt_task h file that's part of the project The configuration parameters for the NET glue layer can be configured with MHC (see MHC Configuration) The demo starts with all parameters having default values (see above) If needed parameters can be adjusted as the application requires Then a connection to the broker can be started using the command: \"mqtt start\" A successful connection should render the following output: The \"mqtt stop\" command can be used to request the ongoing MQTT transaction to be aborted The \"mqtt stat\" can be used to display the current state of the MQTT connection cycle tcpip_wolfmqtt_server_project ",

demonstration project on the target board If the board has a UART connection: A virtual COM port will be detected on the computer when the USB cable is connected to USB-UART connector Open a standard terminal application on the computer (like Hyper-terminal or Tera Term) and configure the virtual COM port Set the serial baud rate to 115200 baud in the terminal application See that the initialization prints on the serial port terminal When the DHCP client is enabled in the demonstration wait for the DHCP server to assign an IP address for the development board This will be printed on the serial port terminal Alternatively: Use the Announce service or ping to get the IP address of the board Run tcpip_discoverer jar to discover the IPv4 and IPv6 address for the board Execution: As soon as a valid IP address is assigned through the DHCP to the demonstration it is ready to accept console commands There are three commands available in the demonstration from the serial port: openurl url - The url argument must be a fully formed URL; for instance https://www microchip com/ ipmode mode - The mode argument selects the IP version 0 - Any IP version 4 - IPv4 only 6 - IPv6 only stats - Output the statistics of the previous openurl run Statistics such as how long each phase of the connection took and how many bytes were transferred After the successful broad bring up the console output becomes tcpip_tcp_client_server_project Input the following command from the serial port: openurl url - The url argument must be a fully formed URL; for instance https://www microchip com/ For this above URL the DNS module will make a DNS query Then it will open a connection to the requested URL and perform a simple HTTP GET command The response received from the server will be printed on the terminal application through the serial port The expected output - tcpip_tcp_client_server_project ",
							" TCP/IP WolfSSL TCP Server This configuration demonstrates creating a simple Internet Web server that operates with clear text (TCP Port 80) and with encrypted text (TCP Port 443) If IPv6 is enabled than the demonstration also serves both types of connections on IPv6 The Web server only serves one page with the text 'Nothing Here' to all Web clients This demonstration uses the NET_PRES layer for encrypted communication through an external service provider for TLS support TCP/IP TCP WolfSSL Server MHC Configuration The following Project Graph diagram shows the Harmony components
