# TCP/IP TCP Server Application

The TCP/IP TCP Server configuration demonstrates creating a network server that uses the MPLAB Harmony TCP API to create a TCP/IP echo server on port 9760.

**TCP/IP TCP Server MHC Configuration**

The following Project Graph diagram shows the Harmony components included in the TCP Server demonstration application.

-   MHC is launched by selecting **Tools \> Embedded \> MPLAB® Harmony 3 Configurator** from the MPLAB X IDE and after successful database migration , TCP/IP demo project is ready to be configured and regenerated.

-   **TCP/IP Root Layer Project Graph**

    1.  TCP/IP stack module with **internal ethmac**

        The root layer project shows that UART2 peripheral is selected to do read and write operation for TCP/IP commands.

        This is the basic configuration with SYS\_CONSOLE, SYS\_DEBUG and SYS\_COMMAND modules. These modules are required for TCP/IP command execution.

        **FreeRTOS** component is required for RTOS application. For bare-metal \(non-RTOS\) **FreeRTOS** component should not be selected.

        **NOTE** - The above diagram contains **FreeRTOS** component and that is required for RTOS application. For bare-metal\(non-RTOS\) **FreeRTOS** component shouldn't be selected.

**Running Demonstration Steps**

1.  Build and download the demonstration project on the target board.

2.  If the board has a UART connection:

    1.  A virtual COM port will be detected on the computer, when the USB cable is connected to USB-UART connector.

    2.  Open a standard terminal application on the computer \(like Hyper-terminal or Tera Term\) and configure the virtual COM port.

    3.  Set the serial baud rate to 115200 baud in the terminal application.

    4.  See that the initialization prints on the serial port terminal.

    5.  When the DHCP client is enabled in the demonstration, wait for the DHCP server to assign an IP address for the development board. This will be printed on the serial port terminal.

        -   Alternatively: Use the Announce service or ping to get the IP address of the board.

        -   Run **tcpip\_discoverer.jar** to discover the IPv4 and IPv6 address for the board.

3.  Execution :

    1.  As soon as a valid IP address is assigned through the DHCP to the demonstration, it is ready to accept a TCP/IP connection on port 9760.

    2.  Send a TCP packet to the IP address of the hardware board using port 9760 from any TCP Client application running on the computer.

    3.  The TCP Server demonstration running on the evaluation kit will echo back everything it receives along the connection.

    4.  For TCP Server test, the TCP Client application is required to run on the computer \(SocketTest, Packet Sender etc\). In this demonstration, we use the program, SocketTest \(http://sockettest.sourceforge.net/\). This demonstration is tested with **SocketTest v3.0**.

        -   Open the **SocketTest** software and set the configuration as shown in the following figure.

            ![tcpip_tcp_server_project](GUID-27BD0B79-02B7-40A1-A73C-ABBAA3B54134-low.png)

        -   Press the Connect button on the **SocketTest** software after setting the configuration. The serial terminal indicates that the connection has been established.

        -   Type any message in the message box of the **SocketTest** program, and press the Send button. The Server running on the development board will echo back the message to the **SocketTest** program.
