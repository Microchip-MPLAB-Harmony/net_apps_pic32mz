# TCP/IP WEB & FTP SERVER Application with MPFS & FATF FS

The Web and FTP Server configuration demonstrates creating an application where HTTP web server will use MPFS FS with NVM media and FTP server will use FAT FS with SDCARD as media.

The Non-Volatile Memory \(NVM\) Microchip Proprietary File System \(MPFS\) is used for storing the web pages in the internal Flash.

The FAT FS File System is used for storing any type of files and FTP server will read from and write to this FS.

**TCP/IP WEB-NET & FTP Server MHC Configuration**

The following Project Graph diagram shows the Harmony components included in the application demonstration.

-   MHC is launched by selecting **Tools \> Embedded \> MPLAB® Harmony 3 Configurator** from the MPLAB X IDE and after successful database migration , TCP/IP demo project is ready to be configured and regenerated.

    -   PIC32MZ EF Device performs read/write to an SD card using SDSPI Module

        SDSPI module is selected with SPI peripheral.

        SDSPI driver uses an instance of the SPI driver to communicate to the SD card over the SPI bus.

        The TCP/IP application demonstrates FAT file system to read/write to an SD card using SDSPI driver. FTP application use SPI peripheral to read/write from SDMMC module.

**TCP/IP WEB-NET & FTP SERVER Running Application**

This application uses more than one FS for the TCP/IP application demonstration. Here HTTP Net server uses Microchip Proprietary File System \(MPFS\) as a read only FS. Here MPFS FS reads web pages from Non-Volatile Memory \(NVM\) media which is used to store the web server pages.

The FAT FS File System read and writes to SDCard memory media which is used for storing any type of files. FTP server will read from and write to this SDcard media using FAT FS.

This table list the name and location of the MPLAB X IDE project folder for the demonstration.

|Project Name|Target Device|Target Development Board|Description|

1.  Ensure a microSD/SD card is formatted and loaded with the web pages provided within the < install-dir \>/net/apps/web\_ftp\_server\_mpfs\_fatfs/firmware/src/web\_pages directory.


**Running Demonstration Steps**

1.  Build and download the demonstration project on the target board.

2.  If the board has a UART connection:

    1.  A virtual COM port will be detected on the computer, when the USB cable is connected to USB-UART connector.

    2.  Open a standard terminal application on the computer \(like Hyper-terminal or Tera Term\) and configure the virtual COM port.

    3.  Set the serial baud rate to 115200 baud in the terminal application.

    4.  See that the initialization prints on the serial port terminal.

    5.  When the DHCP client is enabled in the demonstration, wait for the DHCP server to assign an IP address for the development board. This will be printed on the serial port terminal.

        -   Alternatively: Use the Announce service or ping to get the IP address of the board.

        -   Run **tcpip\_discoverer.jar** to discover the IPv4 and IPv6 address for the board.

3.  Execution:

    An HTTP server is hosted by the demonstration application. Open a web browser and direct it to the board running the HTTP server by typing the URL in the address bar \(for example, https://mchpboard\_c\), and then pressing Enter.

    The demonstration application features following:

    Real-time Hardware Control and Dynamic Variables - On the Overview page the LEDs can be clicked to toggle the LEDs on the Microchip hardware development board. The SWITCHes on the Microchip hardware development board can be pressed to toggle the Buttons on the web page. The dynamic variables can be updated in real-time on the HTTP server.

    **Note:** For the LED and SWITCH functionality portion of the demonstration, configure the GPIOs connected to LEDs and Switches on Microchip hardware development board, through the Pin Configuration manager in MPLAB® Harmony Configurator \(MHC\).

    1.  **Form Processing** - Input can be handled from the client by using the GET and POST methods \(this functionality controls the on-board LEDs and is operational only on the Explorer 16 Development Board\)

    2.  **Authentication** - Shows an example of the commonly used restricted access feature

    3.  **Cookies** - Shows an example of storing small text strings on the client side

    4.  **Server Side Includes** - An example of how SSI can be used to support dynamic content

    5.  **File Uploads** - Shows an example of a file upload using the POST method. The HTTP server can\_accept\_a user-defined MPFS/MPFS2 image file for web pages.

    6.  **Send E-mail** - Shows simple SMTP POST methods

    7.  **Dynamic DNS** - Exercises Dynamic DNS capabilities

    8.  **Network Configuration** - The MAC address, host name, and IP address of the evaluation kit can be viewed in the Network Configuration page and some configurations can be updated

    9.  **MPFS Upload** - A new set of web pages can be uploaded to the web server using this feature, which is accessed through http://mchpboard\_c/mpfsupload

    **Notes:** The location of the MPFS image is fixed at the beginning of the Flash page specified by DRV\_MEMORY\_DEVICE\_START\_ADDRESS. The size of the MPFS upload is limited to DRV\_MEMORY\_DEVICE\_MEDIA\_SIZE in the demonstration. The HTTP File Upload functionality has to be enabled when the project is generated.

4.  FTP Server output -

    Also to transfer file , FTP output –

    Open windows command console and enter FTP server IP address \(here FTP server IP address - 192.168.100.11\) to access the FTP SERVER
