# TCP/IP WEB-NET Server SDCARD FATFS Application

The Web Net Server SDCard configuration demonstrates creating an HTTP web server on a Microchip evaluation board. The FAT FS File System is used for storing the web pages on an external SD Card.

This demonstration uses the HTTP_NET server which supports encrypted communication through the NET_PRES layer and an external service provider for TLS support.
