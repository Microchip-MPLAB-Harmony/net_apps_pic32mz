# TCP/IP WolfSSL MQTT Application

The wolfMQTT application demonstrates a simple MQTT application using the 3rd party wolfMQTT library. 

The application uses the console to implement a simple set of commands to start a MQTT connection to a selected broker. 

The connection parameters can be adjusted using various MQTT related commands. 

This demonstration uses the NET_PRES layer which supports encrypted communication through an external service provider for TLS support (usually wolfSSL).
