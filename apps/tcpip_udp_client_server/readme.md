# TCP/IP UDP Client Server

The UDP Client Server configuration demonstrates creating a network client and a network server that uses the MPLAB Harmony UDP API. This demonstration shows how the UDP/IP loopback works and it is a combination of the TCP/IP UDP Client and TCP/IP UDP Server application.
