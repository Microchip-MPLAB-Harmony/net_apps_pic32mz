# TCP/IP Web Server NVM MPFS Application

The Web Server Non-volatile Memory (NVM) MPFS configuration demonstrates creating an HTTP web server on a Microchip evaluation board.
The Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) Microchip Proprietary File System (MPFS) is used for storing the web pages in the internal Flash.
This demonstration uses the HTTP server which supports encrypted communication through the NET_PRES layer and an external service provider for TLS support.
