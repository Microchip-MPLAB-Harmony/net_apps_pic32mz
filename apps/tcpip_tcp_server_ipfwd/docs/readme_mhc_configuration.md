# TCP/IP TCP IPv4 Forwarding MHC Configuration

The following Project Graph diagram shows the Harmony components included in the TCP Client demonstration application.

* MHC is launched by selecting **Tools > Embedded > MPLABÂ® Harmony 3 Configurator** from the MPLAB X IDE and after successful database migration , TCP/IP demo project is ready to be configured and regenerated.

* **TCP/IP Root Layer Project Graph**

  * TCP/IP stack module with **external mac daughter board**

    Both ENC28j60 and ENCX24j600 daughter board use SPI1 driver and peripheral to communicate with the PIC32MZ EF controller. -

    The root layer project shows that UART2 peripheral is selected to do read and write operation for TCP/IP commands.

    This is the basic configuration with SYS_CONSOLE, SYS_DEBUG and SYS_COMMAND modules. These modules are required for TCP/IP command execution.

    **FreeRTOS** component is required for RTOS application. For bare-metal (non-RTOS) **FreeRTOS** component should not be selected.

    TCP sockets calculate the ISN using the wolfSSL crypto library. 


* **TCP/IP Required Application**

  TCP/IP demo use these application module components for this demo. 
  
  **Announce** module to discover the Microchip devices within a local network.
  
  **DHCP Client** module to discover the IPv4 address from the nearest DHCP Server.
  
  **DNS Client** provides DNS resolution capabilities to the stack.

* **TCPIP Driver Layer**

  **External ENCX24j600 ethernet driver**

    TCP/IP ENCx24j600 driver module selected for the external ethernet  mac ENC28j60 device. For high MAC TX and RX performance DRV_ENCX24j600_MAC_TX_DESCRIPTORS and DRV_ENCX24j600_MAC_RX_DESCRIPTORS can be configured respectively more than the default descriptor value size "2".
